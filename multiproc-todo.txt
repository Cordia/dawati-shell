Post multiproc needed work;

* mnb-toolbar;
  - Contains just date/time and systray. Panels to be added externally in
    meego-netbook.c. See below for API.
  - New public API;

  void
  mnb_toolbar_deactivate_panel (MnbToolbar *toolbar, const gchar *panel_name)

  /* Are we animating (either panel or itself */
  gboolean
