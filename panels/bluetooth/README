Dawati Bluetooth panel

This is a bluetooth panel for Dawati-shell. It handles:
 * bluetooth state through Connman
 * showing currently connected devices through gnome-bluetooth
 * showing current requests (pairing and service auth) through gnome-bluetooth

Note that bluetooth-applet part of gnome-bluetooth is not
really public: the lib and gobject-introspection are installed but
the header is not -- at the moment we have a copy in src/ because
we really really want to use it.

Components:
 * dawati-panel-bt.c:
     main() with the MplPanel integration and the standalone test rig
 * DawatiBtShell:
    Panel UI. Connman, gnome-bluetooth and libnotify calls/handlers
 * DawatiBtDevice:
    UI for a connected device, controlled by DawatiBtShell
 * DawatiBtRequest:
    UI for a request from another device, controlled by DawatiBtShell

Issues/Todo:
 * panel button is broken
 * testing the agent-implementation is bloody difficult -- 
   is it possible to unregister the agent that gnome-shell registers?
   
Tizen issues:
 * gnome-bluetooth not installed on tizen netbook
